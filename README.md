# Loan Approval Prediction System
#### Binary Classification  SMOTE  Logistic Regression vs. Decision Tree

## Introduction
Developed a predictive model to determine loan approval outcomes using a real-world dataset from Kaggle. The system analyzes applicant and loan-related features to classify whether a loan should be approved or rejected. Special focus was placed on handling imbalanced data and evaluating model performance beyond accuracyâ€”using precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing: missing value imputation and categorical encoding
- Binary classification using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
- SMOTE applied to balance class distribution
- Evaluation using confusion matrices and classification reports
- Comparative analysis of model performance on imbalanced data

## Tools & Techniques
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SMOTE
Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## Overview
Built a robust classification pipeline to predict loan approval status. After preprocessing and balancing the dataset, two models were trained and evaluated. The Decision Tree model significantly outperformed Logistic Regression in all metrics.
